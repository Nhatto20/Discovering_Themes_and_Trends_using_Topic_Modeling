Unfortunely, this project has yet to standardize for user input data.

Currently, the product will still be ran on the data on this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AHC1D1iJSyrsjArJIWcQ0Oz2sNTchutd?usp=sharing

if you want to run this product, please install the saved_data file and put it in the same folder as the product.py for it to run probably.

Thank you for your time and sorry for the complicated process.
